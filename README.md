# 📘 R Programming Journey – Data Analytics Projects

## 🎯 Overview
This repository documents my ongoing journey learning and applying **R programming** as part of my Data Analytics studies at **Humber College**. It includes classroom exercises, practice scripts, and personal mini-projects designed to strengthen my skills in data handling, transformation, and basic analysis using R.

I’ll be updating this repo regularly over the next few months as I complete new assignments and explore more advanced topics.
